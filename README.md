# Power BI Data Visualisation
I have created the visualization report of a Cookie Company for three years sales, profit, risks, monthly and yearly revenue and
overall business overview through visualization of the data found in their sheetes.


Step 1: Gathered data from different sources i.e database, website, and inventory regoinal files.

Step 2: Cleaned the data using Power Query and Exel.

Step 3: Loaded all datasets into Power Query Editor for intial cleaning, where I removed unnecessary columns,
handeled missing data, and standardized formats (e.g.< dates and currencies ).

Step 4: Applied transformations such as filtering rows, splitting columns, and creating calculated columns for essential metrics (like "Total Revenue" and
"Sales Growth").

Step 5: Used "Merge" and "Append" functions to combine tables, ensuring a seamless link between tables to enable accurate, integrated analysis across data sources
and customer insights.

Step 6: Performed Data Modeling, established relationships between tables to enable accurate, integrated anlysis across data sources
(e.g., linked "Customer ID" across sales and feed back tables).

Step 7: Created visualizations, presented sales data in donut chart, showing sum of units sold by country.

Step 8: Presented Sum of Revenue by Date and Location a beautiful clustered stacked bar chart.

Step 9: Created a stacked bar chart to visualize sum of profit by location.

Step 10: Added a table at the top of the dashboard to present an overview of all the data and visualizations we created,
including country name, date, day, time, sum of profits, units sold, product name, sum of revenue.

Step 11: Added a slicer on top right corner to select location wise data on each visual we created.

Step 12: Then I created a live dynamic Map visual we created.

Step 13: Added a Slicer on page 1 to select country wise data with a single click.

Step 14: I created a colorful pie chart to show our monthly and yearly revenue by date.

Step 15: To visualize the yearly profit by date I created a Line Chart to easily see profit date wise.

Step 16: Created Mobile-App version and Web-App dashboard to present data to our client easily on both the platforms.

# Cleaning and Analyzing Student Scores with NumPy

Introduction
This project demonstrates how to clean a dataset with missing values and calculate basic statistics (mean, maximum, and minimum) using Python and the NumPy library. Here’s a detailed breakdown of each step, from setting up the data to the final analysis.

Step 1: Setting Up the Project
Import Libraries:
First, I imported the necessary library, NumPy, which provides powerful tools for numerical data manipulation and analysis.

Step 2: Initializing the Data
Creating the Dataset:
I created a dataset with sample scores and introduced a few missing values. Missing values were represented as None to simulate incomplete data.

Step 3: Filtering Out Missing Values
Handling Missing Data:
To calculate an average without including missing values, I filtered out None values from the dataset. This allowed me to compute the mean of the available scores accurately.

Step 4: Calculating the Average Score
Finding the Mean of the Filtered Data:
With the filtered dataset, I calculated the average (mean) score, which would later be used to fill in the missing values.

Step 5: Replacing Missing Values
Filling Missing Values with the Mean:
I replaced all None values in the original dataset with the calculated average. This resulted in a "cleaned" dataset with no missing values.

Step 6: Calculating Basic Statistics
Finding Mean, Maximum, and Minimum of Cleaned Data:
I used NumPy functions to calculate key statistics on the cleaned dataset. These included:
Mean: The overall average score
Maximum: The highest score
Minimum: The lowest score

Step 7: Displaying the Results
Printing the Results:
Finally, I printed the calculated mean, maximum, and minimum scores to display a summary of the cleaned data.

Conclusion
In this project, I successfully:

Created a dataset with missing values.
Replaced missing values with the mean to complete the dataset.
Used NumPy to calculate key statistical metrics.
This project highlights my ability to handle missing data, clean datasets, and extract useful insights using basic statistical functions in Python.

Future Improvements
To expand on this project, I could:

Add visualizations of the cleaned data.
Experiment with different methods to handle missing data

# SeaBorn Librarys

This project uses Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze and visualize the dataset. Matplotlib allows custom plotting, while Seaborn simplifies statistical visualizations and uncovers 
insights.

Step 1: Begin by importing the necessary libraries. You will need Matplotlib for creating various plots and Seaborn for making statistical plots.

Step 2: Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. For example, we can use a sample dataset like seaborn’s built-in tips dataset or a custom CSV file.

Step 3: It’s important to understand the structure of the dataset to know which columns to visualize.

Step 4: Perform any necessary data cleaning steps, such as handling missing values, converting columns, or dropping unnecessary columns.

Step 5: Create a simple plot to get started with Matplotlib. You can plot basic charts like line plots, bar charts, histograms, etc.

Step 6: Seaborn is great for statistical plots. You can create visualizations like scatter plots, box plots, violin plots, and more, with less code.

Step 7: Both Matplotlib and Seaborn allow for extensive customization of plots, including adjusting labels, titles, and colors.

Step 8: If you want to compare multiple plots in one figure, you can use subplots in Matplotlib.

Step 9: Once your plot looks the way you want, you can save it as an image or other formats.

Step 10: For interactive plots, you can use plotly or matplotlib with mpl_toolkits, but Matplotlib and Seaborn don't provide built-in interactivity. Alternatively, use seaborn's 
built-in FacetGrid or matplotlib's interactive mode.

Here are some Examples:

![Figure 3:](https://github.com/Hashirkoukab/My-Projects/blob/main/Images/Figure%203.png)

In conclusion, Matplotlib and Seaborn were essential tools in analyzing and visualizing the dataset. By combining Matplotlib's flexibility and Seaborn's ease of use for statistical 
plots, I was able to uncover valuable insights and present the data in a clear, impactful way. These visualizations provide a solid foundation for decision-making and further 
analysis.
